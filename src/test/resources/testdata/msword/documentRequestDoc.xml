<PANDA baseURI="/WordTest/text/"><value type="xs:string" subURI="9">HYPERLINK &quot;http://www.ogc.gov.uk/&quot;www.ogc.gov.uk</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="21">The Public Sector spends around Â£220bn  each year on procurement in over 44,000 organisations right across the UK in every sector that government operates. Public sector spend often constitutes a large percentage of a given supply market â€“ often between 10% and 15%.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="22">The OGCâ€™s Procurement Programme was established to implement the recommendations of the Transforming Government Procurement report of 2007.  The programme brings Public Sector buyers together into common approaches to supply markets where Government is a major buyer.  Each year the programme runs a survey of Public Sector procurement by market facing category.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="23">This document provides the detail that departments have put forward in response to the latest survey.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="25">The information is provided in a number of formats in addition to the plain format tables in this document</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="27">As an Excel templated table</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="29">As a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="31">As an interactive toolkit allowing navigation</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="34">On the data:</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="36">Figures quoted are payments made based upon in-year actuals and do not relate to commitment or contracted volumes.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="37">Figures are requested net of VAT.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="38">In some cases department submissions may be incomplete or represent only part of the total family.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="39">Figures relate to the financial year 2008/9. Figures for 2009/10 will be collated in the next PSPES exercise.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="40">Figures quoted relate to version 1.2 of the PSPES analysis. Subsequent updates to figures have not been included.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="41">This data set represents operational management information used by departments in the management of their procurement. It has not been subject to independent audit or assurance.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="42">This data set does not represent National Statistics.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="43">This data differs from the information from COINS released in June 2010. COINS represents how finance was applied to activity including procurement, PSPES reflects a commercial operation perspective.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="44">Where totals are quoted that include Wider Public Sector spend, an element of this is extrapolated from a large sample of Wider Public Sector organisations.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="45">In several cases department submissions are based on an analysis of accounts payable which in some cases is predicated upon the principle business of a supplier only. Where a supplier operates across multiple supply markets this can have a distorting effect in these cases. For example, in some cases it is not possible to distinguish between spend with a major telecoms provider on managed services and spend with the same supplier on ICT telecommunications.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="46">In all cases, figures are set out as provided by departments at the level of granularity provided. This level varies across departments.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="48">On the categorisation:</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="50">The categorisation structure used has been developed in consultation with government commercial departments. It reflects the market category from which a good or service was procured. This is not the same as the reason for its procurement. So, for example, some procurement of goods and services for Social Care â€“ such as care home provision â€“ is from the Social Care supply market; but insofar as social workers use computers, pens and paper, some of the Social Care budget will in fact be expended on the ICT or Office Solutions supply markets.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="51">This effect is particularly apparent in the Defence category where Â£7.5bn is categorised to the supply market. This is significantly less than the total procurement budgets for the Ministry of Defence. The difference is goods and services procured by the MoD from supply markets other than Defence, such as fuel.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="52">The reverse side of this effect explains why in some cases category totals are higher than might be expected. For example, Professional Services master category grouping includes many of the managed service procurements that contribute to front line delivery across the board.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="53">In some cases departments are procuring in categories that may on first sight seem unexpected; for example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has expenditure in the Social Care master category â€“ in fact this is their World Programmes expenditure.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="54">In the case of managed service arrangements where there is no second tier supply chain category breakdown this can distort the total supply chain market value at a lower tier level. For example, where catering is procured as part of a broader facilities management contract, it is not always possible to break this spend out into the catering category.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="55">Although detailed guidance is available in support of the categorisation process, it is inevitable that a degree of subjectivity persists in departmental analysis of their data.  What one department considers to be an office machine within the office solution master category, another may manage as part of a managed service in the ICT category.</value><value type="xs:string" subURI="56">BIS was formed in a Machinery of Government change that took place in the middle of the period under consideration. Included here within the BIS family are all Arms Length Bodies that currently form part of the BIS delivery chain, albeit they may not have done at the start of 2008. DIUS core spend is considered separately here but this will be amalgamated in future versions.</value></PANDA>

<PANDA baseURI="/PdfTest/text/3/"><value type="xs:string" subURI="1">Publication of Spend Data </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="2">  3 </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="3">On the data: </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="4"> </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="5">ï?® Figures quoted are payments made based upon in-year actuals and do not relate to commitment or </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="6">contracted volumes. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="7">ï?® Figures are requested net of VAT. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="8">ï?® In some cases department submissions may be incomplete or represent only part of the total family.  </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="9">ï?® Figures relate to the financial year 2008/9. Figures for 2009/10 will be collated in the next PSPES </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="10">exercise. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="11">ï?® Figures quoted relate to version 1.2 of the PSPES analysis. Subsequent updates to figures have not been </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="12">included. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="13">ï?® This data set represents operational management information used by departments in the management of </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="14">their procurement. It has not been subject to independent audit or assurance. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="15">ï?® This data set does not represent National Statistics. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="16">ï?® This data differs from the information from COINS released in June 2010. COINS represents how finance </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="17">was applied to activity including procurement, PSPES reflects a commercial operation perspective.   </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="18">ï?® Where totals are quoted that include Wider Public Sector spend, an element of this is extrapolated from a </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="19">large sample of Wider Public Sector organisations. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="20">ï?® In several cases department submissions are based on an analysis of accounts payable which in some </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="21">cases is predicated upon the principle business of a supplier only. Where a supplier operates across </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="22">multiple supply markets this can have a distorting effect in these cases. For example, in some cases it is </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="23">not possible to distinguish between spend with a major telecoms provider on managed services and </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="24">spend with the same supplier on ICT telecommunications. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="25">ï?® In all cases, figures are set out as provided by departments at the level of granularity provided. This level </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="26">varies across departments.  </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="27"> </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="28">On the categorisation: </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="29"> </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="30">ï?® The categorisation structure used has been developed in consultation with government commercial </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="31">departments. It reflects the market category from which a good or service was procured. This is not the </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="32">same as the reason for its procurement. So, for example, some procurement of goods and services for </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="33">Social Care â€“ such as care home provision â€“ is from the Social Care supply market; but insofar as social </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="34">workers use computers, pens and paper, some of the Social Care budget will in fact be expended on the </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="35">ICT or Office Solutions supply markets. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="36">ï?® This effect is particularly apparent in the Defence category where Â£7.5bn is categorised to the supply </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="37">market. This is significantly less than the total procurement budgets for the Ministry of Defence. The </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="38">difference is goods and services procured by the MoD from supply markets other than Defence, such as </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="39">fuel. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="40">ï?® The reverse side of this effect explains why in some cases category totals are higher than might be </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="41">expected. For example, Professional Services master category grouping includes many of the managed </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="42">service procurements that contribute to front line delivery across the board. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="43">ï?® In some cases departments are procuring in categories that may on first sight seem unexpected; for </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="44">example, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has expenditure in the Social Care master category â€“ in </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="45">fact this is their World Programmes expenditure. </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="46">ï?® In the case of managed service arrangements where there is no second tier supply chain category </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="47">breakdown this can distort the total supply chain market value at a lower tier level. For example, where </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="48">catering is procured as part of a broader facilities management contract, it is not always possible to break </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="49">this spend out into the catering category.  </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="50">ï?® Although detailed guidance is available in support of the categorisation process, it is inevitable that a </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="51">degree of subjectivity persists in departmental analysis of their data.  What one department considers to </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="52">be an office machine within the office solution master category, another may manage as part of a </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="53">managed service in the ICT category.  </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="54">ï?® BIS was formed in a Machinery of Government change that took place in the middle of the period under </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="55">consideration. Included here within the BIS family are all Arms Length Bodies that currently form part of </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="56">the BIS delivery chain, albeit they may not have done at the start of 2008. DIUS core spend is considered </value><value type="xs:string" subURI="57">separately here but this will be amalgamated in future versions. &#xD;</value></PANDA>
